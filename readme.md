## "A Python API wrapper for FreeDNS.afraid.org" as a super-simplified web-interface

A fork of the original FreeDNS API wrapper repo, just used as a web interface. Static content served using the `flask` module

Captcha images are rendered on the server and shown as an `<img>`

Not intended for any sort of use production-wise. Not sure why you would want to anyway
